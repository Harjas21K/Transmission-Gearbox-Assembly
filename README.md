# Transmission-Gearbox-Assembly
# Transmission Gearbox Assembly – AutoCAD Project

This repository documents the development, design, and analysis of a **Transmission Gearbox Assembly** created using **AutoCAD**. This project is part of my ongoing journey as a Mechanical Engineering student and demonstrates my skills in CAD modeling, mechanical design, and technical documentation.

## 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a detailed and functional 3D model of a **manual transmission gearbox**, illustrating its internal components and mechanical relationships. The assembly showcases engineering principles related to gear systems, shafts, bearings, and casing.

## 🛠️ Software & Tools

- **AutoCAD 2024**
- (Optional) Autodesk Inventor / Fusion 360 (if used for 3D visualization)
- PDF Export for 2D drawings
- DWG format for original design files
